title: "Finalizing Workstation & Peripheral Needs"

During Week 3 of the IAP Network Project, our focus shifted to finalizing the hardware and workstation requirements for the new network. Based on the RFP and the organization’s structure, I researched and confirmed the specifications for 25 desktop computers and 8 laptops, ensuring that all devices would be running Windows 11 as per the technical requirements. Each desktop was assigned a mouse and keyboard, while the laptops were matched with a mouse only. Additionally, 5 monitors were designated for the laptops, which would be used by the company’s mobile officers when they return to the office.

I also reviewed the need for peripheral devices such as printers and scanners, which led to the decision to use a combined printer/scanner unit for simplicity and efficiency. Understanding the layout and staff roles helped us ensure the hardware aligned with day-to-day operations. This week gave me practical experience in hardware planning for a corporate environment, and I learned how to match hardware choices with user needs, space planning, and budgeting, all while keeping system compatibility and scalability in mind.
