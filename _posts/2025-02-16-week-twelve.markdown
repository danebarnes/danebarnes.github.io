This week, I focused on establishing a personal documentation site using Jekyll, which would serve as both a journal for the project progress and a personal portfolio of my skillset and body of work. The goal was to create a clean, professional, and organized web space to host weekly journal entries, highlight technical milestones, and showcase the skills developed throughout the IAP project.

I began by setting up a basic Jekyll site structure locally on my machine, customizing the layout to include sections such as the homepage, about page, journal, and project summary. I explored how Markdown files are used to populate the content and how Liquid templating works to control layout and styling across the site. The blog-like structure of Jekyll proved ideal for organizing weekly entries and updates in a chronological and readable format.

This experience deepened my understanding of static site generators, version control, and lightweight web publishing, all while reinforcing the value of clear documentation in any IT-related project. It also highlighted the importance of presentation and communication, ensuring that technical work is both visible and accessible to evaluators and potential employers.
