In week two of the project, our team continued working on the RFP response by refining our assigned sections and ensuring consistency in the document. I focused on drafting the cover letter and company profile, incorporating feedback from the group to create a professional and well-structured introduction to our proposal. Additionally, we finalized our meeting schedules to keep track of progress and ensure all members stayed aligned with the project timeline.

This week reinforced my understanding of formal project documentation and the importance of collaborative editing and feedback in professional writing. I also improved my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly while maintaining a structured and professional tone. By the end of the week, we had made significant progress on the proposal, setting a strong foundation for the upcoming technical requirements and project breakdown phases.
