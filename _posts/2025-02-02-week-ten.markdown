title: "Installation and Configuration of Linux File Server"

This week’s focus was on expanding the network infrastructure by adding a Linux-based file server to complement the Windows domain environment. The file server was set up using Ubuntu Server and installed as a virtual machine within VMware Workstation 17 Player. The device was named iap-fileserver and was assigned a static IP address of 192.168.100.101 to ensure consistent connectivity.

Once the server was operational, I proceeded to install and configure Samba to enable file sharing between the Linux server and Windows clients on the domain. A single shared directory was created with the necessary permissions, and Samba was configured to support user-level security. A Samba user account was also added to simulate file access from domain machines. Connectivity and functionality were verified by mapping the shared folder from the Windows 10 client, which confirmed that file sharing was working as expected.

This week provided valuable experience in Linux server deployment, network setup, and the integration of Linux-based services into a Windows environment—an essential skill in managing mixed-OS networks.
