title: "Attempted Installation of Exchange Server 2016"

This weekâ€™s main focus was the installation and configuration of Microsoft Exchange Server 2016, which presented several technical challenges. Multiple attempts were made to install the server on a Windows Server 2012 R2 virtual machine, but the installation would consistently freeze mid-process. The issue persisted regardless of whether the standard GUI installer or an unattended installation was used. In one attempt, I executed the following PowerShell command to install Exchange via the command line:
`Setup.exe /Mode:Install /Roles:Mailbox /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms /InstallWindowsComponents`

Despite this method, the installation continued to hang. After reinstalling the base Windows Server environment multiple times and repeating the process, the team reviewed the official Microsoft Exchange documentation and discovered that Exchange Server 2016 requires a minimum of 8 GB of RAM for the Mailbox role to install and function properly. The host machine being used for the virtual environment only had 5.95 GB of usable RAM, which was insufficient. This realization clarified the installation failures and emphasized the importance of validating hardware resource availability against software requirements, especially for enterprise-grade systems like Exchange Server 2016.
