Hi, I'm **O'Daine Barnes** â€” a tech enthusiast with a passion for problem-solving and continuous learning. I'm currently pursuing an **Associate Degree in Computer System Technology** at **Vector Technology Institute**, where I'm building a strong foundation in IT and software development.

I'm proficient in **Python**, have a working knowledge of **HTML** and **CSS**, and I'm currently growing my skills in **JavaScript**. I enjoy dabbling in code and exploring how things work under the hood.

Professionally, I work as a **Merchant Services Officer** at **First Global Bank Limited**, where I manage the provisioning, troubleshooting, and logistics of POS systems. While most of my experience has been in the banking sector, I naturally gravitate toward technical roles.

My long-term goal is to transition into the field of **Cybersecurity**, where I can combine my technical skills and industry experience to make a meaningful impact.
