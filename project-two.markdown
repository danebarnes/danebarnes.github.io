# Virtual Network Setup

**Vector Technology Institute**
**ICT Application Project ‚Äî IAP Automotives**  
**Fictitious Company Network Upgrade Simulation**

## üõ† Project Overview

As part of the ICT Application Project for the Associate Degree in Computer Systems Technology (ACST) at Vector Technology Institute, I was part of a team tasked with designing and implementing a virtual network for a fictitious company aiming to upgrade its infrastructure.

The project involved setting up a fully functional Windows domain environment, complete with servers, client machines, DNS, DHCP, web services, email, file sharing, and directory services. This setup was virtualized using **VMware Workstation Player 17**.

## üß† Project Objectives

- Implement a Windows-based domain environment
- Use a Linux-based file server for shared resources
- Configure DNS, DHCP, and ADDS on a domain controller
- Create web and intranet servers with custom URLs
- Set up a secure mail server using Exchange 2016
- Enable central authentication and group-based file sharing
- Simulate a real-world corporate network environment
